  \vspace{3pt}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BookWorm}: Created a GUI application for the 2019 FBLA Coding \& Programming event, which helped librarians manage and distribute copies of DRM-protected eBooks. The project won first place at the Georgia FBLA SLC, and fifth place at the FBLA NLC.
    \item \textbf{Traveller}: In a team of two, created an application that solved specific implementations of the travelling salesman problem. Using OpenStreetMap data, we created a router using the greedy method and Dijkstra's algorithm to generate the shortest path between multiple points of interest.
    \item \textbf{SECurity-py}: Created a program to historically analyze trends between quarterly filings provided by the SEC. By evaluating quarterly 13F-HR forms, SECurity-py builds models of the decisions large investment funds make over time.
