  {\large \textbf{\textsc{Projects}}}\hspace{5pt}\xrfill[.5ex]{.4pt}

  \vspace{3pt}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BookWorm}: Created a GUI application using Qt and Python for the 2019 FBLA Coding \& Programming event, which helped librarians manage and distribute copies of DRM-protected eBooks. The API backend was written in Crystal using the Kemal routing DSL, which integrated into a SQLite database. The project won first place at the Georgia FBLA SLC, and fifth place at the FBLA NLC.
    \item \textbf{Traveller}: In a team of two, created an application in Nim that solved specific implementations of the travelling salesman problem. Using OpenStreetMap data, we created a router using the greedy method and Dijkstra's algorithm to generate the shortest path between multiple points of interest.
    \item \textbf{SECurity-py}: Created a Python program to historically analyze trends between quarterly filings provided by the SEC. The program tracks holdings between quarters listed in 13F-HR forms and reports analytics over a specified period of time. It also has both a GUI facet written in Qt Widgets, and Excel integration using the library xlwings.
    \item \textbf{MATH 2803 Research}: Researched the topic of Big-O notation and algorithm runtime by creating an analyzing various factoring algorithms in Julia using Jupyter notebook.
